# Draft FHGM contract examples

These synthetic fixtures use the released FHGFF3 1.1 identity and add one
experimental header key, `x-fhgm-models`. The fictional accession and model
IDs are scoped to this demonstration. The reference digest describes the
one-record synthetic collection in the [revision pilot](../revision/README.md).

- [Minimal](minimal.fhgff3.gff3) describes one noncoding locus with one
  transcript and one exon. The model carries an ID, version and feature pointer.
- [Rich](rich.fhgff3.gff3) describes the next snapshot of that locus, now with
  two isoforms. It adds an experimental predecessor pointer, contributor role
  and evidence record. The annotation title and protocol remain ordinary
  FHGFF3 fields. The predecessor checksum is the minimal fixture's checksum.

The added header metadata lives entirely under the experimental key. The
feature payload uses ordinary GFF3 coordinates and native `ID` and `Parent`
relationships. A model-layer validator would resolve the selected feature and
check its type and scope, while a GFF3 validator checks the feature graph.
There is no CDS or protein requirement for a noncoding model.

Both headers validate against the released FHGFF3 1.1 JSON Schema at
`v0.5.0`, with format checking, and their exact-byte checksums verify. See
the [review and compatibility matrix](../../CONTRACT-REVIEW.md) for limits
and recommendations.
